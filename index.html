            <h2>Tokyo, the mixes of ultramodern and traditional</h2>
            <p>
              From neon-lit skyscrapers to historic temples, the opulent Meiji
              Shinto Shrine is known for its towering gate and surrounding
              woods. The Imperial Palace sits amid large public gardens. The
              city's many museums offer exhibits ranging from classical art (in
              the Tokyo National Museum) to a reconstructed kabuki theater (in
              the Edo-Tokyo Museum).

                <h4>Ekibenya Matsuri</h4>
                <p>
                  Part of the ritual of riding a shinkansen (bullet train) is
                  enjoying a bento and green tea (or sake if you like), while
                  taking in the view. Located inside of Tokyo Station, Ekibenya
                  Matsuri offers about 170 regional ekiben (“eki” for station
                  and “ben” short for bento box) brought in from throughout
                  Japan, an excellent chance to enjoy a range of regional
                  Japanese flavors. The colorful selection includes rice topped
                  with sashimi, wagyu beef, or yakitori grilled chicken skewers,
                  and there is even a gyutan beef tongue bento that contains a
                  warming device activated by a pull-string, allowing you to
                  enjoy a hot meal on your journey. The shop opens at 5:30 a.m.
                  for anyone catching an early train.

                <h4>Pelican Cafe</h4>
                <p>
                  Pelican Bakery has been baking white bread since 1942. The
                  bread is so popular that all orders must be placed in advance
                  for the privilege of purchasing a loaf. Pelican Café, which
                  recently opened down the street from the bakery, is a chance
                  for more people to try the sought-after bread. The menu
                  focuses on toast and sandwiches, including a thick-cut ham
                  katsu and another composed of fresh fruit with whipped cream.
                  There are also toasts topped with cheese, sweet adzuki beans
                  and butter, or simply butter and jam. The cafe is often busy,
                  mostly with young people. Pelican is near the famous Asakusa
                  district, home of the Asakusa Shrine, making it an easy stop
                  for sightseers.

                <p>
                  Built around a beautiful traditional garden, Tofuya Ukai’s
                  low-rise complex of private rooms offers a glimpse of how
                  Tokyo used to look and dine before the modern high-rise city
                  developed. Multicourse meals include elaborate appetizers —
                  like the specialty artisan bean curd served in hot pots in
                  winter or chilled in summer — and culminate in servings of
                  fish or meat grilled at the table.
